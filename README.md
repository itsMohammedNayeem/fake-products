Application Components:
ProductList Component:

This is the main component that will display a list of products.
It will fetch data from the first API (https://fakestoreapi.com/carts/2) to get product IDs and quantities.
ProductDetail Component:

This component will display the detailed information for each product.
It will fetch data from the second API (https://fakestoreapi.com/products/{id}) using the product ID from the first API.
Data Fetching and State Management:
Fetching Data:

In the ProductList component, use useEffect to call the first API and store the result in a local state.
For each product ID obtained, make a call to the second API to fetch product details.
Combining Data:

Combine the product details with the quantities from the first API response.
You can create a function to merge these data based on the product ID.
State Management:

Use local state (useState hook) if the state doesn't need to be shared across different components.
For global state management (if required in the future), consider using Redux or Context API.
Performance Considerations:
Optimizing API Calls:

Use Promise.all to fetch all product details in parallel, to reduce waiting time.
Be cautious of the number of simultaneous requests to avoid hitting API rate limits.
Caching:

Implement caching mechanisms to avoid refetching data unnecessarily. This can be done using React state, local storage, or libraries like React Query.
Lazy Loading:

If the product list is long, consider implementing lazy loading for the product details.
UI and UX:
Loading States:

Display a loading spinner or placeholder while fetching data.
Error Handling:

Implement graceful error handling for failed API calls, displaying user-friendly messages.
Responsive Design:

Ensure your application is responsive to different screen sizes.
Code Quality and Best Practices:
Reusable Components:

Design ProductList and ProductDetail components to be reusable and maintainable.
Error Boundaries:

Use React error boundaries for handling unexpected UI errors.
Code Linting and Formatting:

Use tools like ESLint and Prettier.
Comments and Documentation:

Write clear comments and maintain documentation for your codebase.
